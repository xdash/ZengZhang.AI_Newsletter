CLI client for [podwise.ai](https://podwise.ai) — turn any podcast episode into AI-powered insights, designed for use in AI agents and skills workflows.

Podwise transforms hours of podcasts into transcripts, summaries, outlines, Q&A, and mind maps. This CLI is purpose-built as a **tool for AI agents** — letting LLMs, skills runtimes, and automation pipelines fetch structured podcast insights without a browser or human in the loop.

`brew install hardhackerlabs/podwise-tap/podwise`
Run the following command to install the latest version of `podwise`:

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hardhackerlabs/podwise-cli/main/install.sh | sh`
1. Download the latest binary for your OS and architecture from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hardhackerlabs/podwise-cli/releases) .
2. Unpack the archive (e.g., `tar -xzf podwise_linux_amd64.tar.gz` ).
3. Move the `podwise` binary to a directory in your PATH, for example:mv podwise /usr/local/bin/
4. Make sure it's executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/podwise` .

If you have Go installed, you can build and install the binary directly from the source:

```
git clone https://github.com/hardhackerlabs/podwise-cli.git
cd podwise-cli
go build -o podwise .
# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, e.g.,
mv podwise /usr/local/bin/
```
Authorize the CLI in your browser and let it save the API key automatically:

```
# Open the browser authorization flow
podwise auth
# Verify connection
podwise config show
```
If you already have an API key, you can still set it manually:

`podwise config set api_key your-sk-xxxx`
The configuration is stored at `~/.config/podwise/config.toml`.

**Prerequisites:** Before installing skills, make sure you have completed the [Installation](#installation) and [Configuration](#configuration) steps above — the `podwise` CLI must be installed and your `api_key` must be set.


The Podwise skill routes your intent to the right workflow automatically:

| Workflow | What it does | 
|---|---|
| **catch-up** | Catch up on missed episodes from podcasts you follow | 
| **weekly-recap** | Generate a weekly listening recap with highlights | 
| **episode-notes** | Export episode summaries and highlights to Notion, Obsidian, or Logseq | 
| **topic-research** | Research a topic across multiple podcast episodes | 
| **episode-debate** | Challenge and stress-test ideas from an episode | 
| **language-learning** | Generate Anki flashcards from a transcript | 
| **discover** | Get personalised podcast recommendations based on your taste | 
| **refine-taste** | Build your listener profile for personalised outputs | 

When you ask the agent something related to podcasts, it:

1. Loads Podwise CLI reference docs
2. Matches your intent to the right workflow (if applicable)
3. Loads and executes the workflow steps, or runs the CLI command directly

`npx skills add hardhackerlabs/podwise-cli`
You can also build your own skills on top of the `podwise` CLI to create custom workflows that fit your needs.

Podwise exposes all its capabilities as an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, allowing AI assistants (Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) to search episodes, process media, and retrieve AI-generated content directly as tools.

Start the MCP server (communicates over stdin/stdout):

`podwise mcp`
The server exposes the following tools:

| Tool | Description | 
|---|---|
| `search_episode` | Search for podcast episodes by title keywords | 
| `search_podcast` | Search for podcasts by name | 
| `popular` | List current trending/popular podcast episodes | 
| `process` | Submit a YouTube / 小宇宙 / Podwise URL or local file for AI processing | 
| `get_transcript` | Fetch the full transcript (text / SRT / VTT) | 
| `get_summary` | Fetch the AI-generated summary and key takeaways | 
| `get_qa` | Fetch AI-extracted Q&A pairs | 
| `get_chapters` | Fetch the chapter breakdown with timestamps | 
| `get_mindmap` | Fetch the AI-generated mind map | 
| `get_highlights` | Fetch notable highlights with timestamps | 
| `get_keywords` | Fetch topic keywords with descriptions | 
| `ask` | Ask the AI a question answered from podcast transcripts | 
| `drill` | List recent episodes for a specific podcast by its Podwise URL | 
| `follow` | Follow a podcast by its Podwise URL (idempotent) | 
| `unfollow` | Unfollow a podcast by its Podwise URL (idempotent) | 
| `list_episodes` | List recent episodes from podcasts you follow, filterable by date or day range | 
| `list_podcasts` | List followed podcasts with new episodes, filterable by date or day range | 
| `history_read` | List episodes you have read, sorted by most recent first | 
| `history_listened` | List episodes you have listened, sorted by most recent first |
